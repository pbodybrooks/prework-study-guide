# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide is used as a repository for useful information pertaining to the four main topics learned in the Bootcamp Prework modules, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.

It is to be used by students to access helpful tips relevant to these topics and was built to serve as a reference for later coursework throughout the Bootcamp.

It also serves as a helpful coding exercise to practice the very funamentals of web development.

Throughout the process of creating the study guide, I learned much about the structures, uses, and syntaxes of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the correct way to work with a GitHub repository.

Opening the DevTools console reveals the JavaScript running, displays the topics we covered in the Prework modules, and can be used as a method for randomly selecting a topic of study.
